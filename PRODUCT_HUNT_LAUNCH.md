# 🚀 Krypto Trac - Product Hunt Launch Post

## Tagline
**The crypto tracker with Fort Knox security. Zero passwords. Zero backdoors. Zero compromises.**

## 🎯 The Pitch

**For Crypto Traders Who Refuse to Compromise**

Krypto Trac isn't just another price tracker—it's a **digital Fort Knox** that protects your portfolio while giving you institutional-grade intelligence.

**The Problem:**
- Crypto trackers are either insecure (storing passwords) or feature-limited
- Traders lose funds to phishing scams every day
- Whale movements affect prices, but most apps show alerts too late

**The Solution:**
Krypto Trac combines three layers of military-grade security with AI-powered market intelligence:

1. **The Vault (Colony OS)** - Every action is cryptographically signed. No passwords. No session tokens. Even if we're breached, your funds are safe.

2. **The Sentinel (Vertex AI)** - An AI guardian that scans every transaction before you sign. It detects phishing, infinite approvals, and front-running risks in real-time.

3. **The Intelligence** - Predict whale movements using Gemini 1.5 Flash. See market sentiment shifts before they happen.
